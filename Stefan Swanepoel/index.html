                <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                
                <p>When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.</p>

            <h2>Great movie for robots vs monsters anime fans</h2>
            
            <p>I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in 3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)</p>
            <p>To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.</p>
            <p>Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.</p>

            <h2>Worth the wait, time and money...Brilliant!</h2>
            
            <p>I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. Watched it in 3D (I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast.</p>
            <p>Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent (thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!</p>
            <p>Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best yet. His imagination is wicked. So if you are looking for great entertainment and a little something to wow you, this is the movie for you. </p>
            <p>Bravo. Two thumbs up. </p>

            <h2>Let your inner-nerd out. This is AMAZING.</h2>
            
            <p>I literally could not stop myself from writing this review. There's just so much to talk about, I don't know where to begin...but let's just get this out of the way... PACIFIC RIM IS A 5 OUT OF FREAKIN' 5. Guillermo Del Toro, you deserve a standing ovation. From an unbiased, stand-alone movie point of view, this film does an incredible job of being exciting from beginning to end, while still developing an awesome back story and character depth. Charlie Hunnan (of Sons of Anarchy fame) solidifies himself as a good, respectable action movie star, but Idris Elba CRUSHES his role, and steals every scene he's in. Solid acting all-around, much better than what you might expect from an action movie like this. THE ACTION IS TOP-OF-THE-LINE. What is there to compare this to...Transformers? Transformers WISHES IT COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO PACIFIC RIM WHEN IT COMES TO EPIC-CGI-ACTION SEQUENCES. Every hit, every explosion, every gut-wrenching Kaiju kill is a work of art. A new gold standard has been set. VISUALS AND GRAPHICS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE IMAX 3D TREATMENT. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE PART OF YOUR BLU-RAY COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE VIEWED ON 9 BIG-SCREEN TVS STACKED ON YOUR LIVING ROOM WALL. Do not cheat yourself by simply doing 2D on this one. OK, now the nerd-out part of this review. If you are a nerd in any way, shape or form, then this movie is for you. And if you're an anime nerd, then this is your favorite movie ever. EVER. The inspirations from and references to Godzilla are obvious, but you're very likely to notice influences from several different sources. Anime fan? Then I dare you to not see the nods to Big O, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gundam, or even Gurren Lagaan. That female computer voice sound familiar? Maybe that's because it's the voice actress of GLaDoS, from the motherf*cking Portal games. Your inner nerd won't know what to freak out over more. 5 out of 5, gold star, thumbs up, A++, 100%, NOW STOP READING THIS AND GO SEE IT!!!</p>
