  <h2>Tsotsi movie review 2005</h2>
  <p>With Presley Chuenyagae</p>

        </p>
        <p>"Tsotsi," a film of deep emotional power, considers a young killer whose cold eyes show no emotion, who kills unthinkingly, and who is transformed by the helplessness of a baby. He didn't mean to kidnap the baby, but now that he has it, it looks at him with trust and need, and he is powerless before eyes more demanding than his own.

  <h4>Tsotsi the movie review</h4>
  <p>"Tsotsi" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film features scenes of extreme violence, and the sight of a real baby crying so much may upset some viewers.

<h4>Tsotsi</h4>


Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.

Directed by Gavin Hood; written (in Tsotsitaal, with English subtitles) by Mr. Hood, based on the novel by Athol Fugard; director of photography, Lance Gewer; edited by Megan Gill; music by Mark Kilian and Paul Hepker, with the featured vocalist Vusi Mahlasela; production designer, Emelia Weavind; produced by Peter Fudakowski; released by Miramax Films. Running time: 94 minutes..

Tsotsi is not an easy movie to watch, but it grabs you by the collar and never eases its grip. Closed-minded people like to believe that change is impossible, and that someone with all the makings of a social defect has no shot of crawling out of the dark. The film challenges that viewpoint by showing a menacing criminal that seems completely hopeless, until an unexpected incident threatens to humanize him. Director Gavin Hood keeps the movie moving at a breezy, unsentimental clip with a fast-paced, gritty style similar to City Of God, while energetic Kwaito music blasts throughout the picture. He keeps Tsotsi away from pretentious narration that tells us what to feel, and instead lets things unfold naturally.</p>
